The intention behind this repository is to make source code of the server side
components of Estonian internet-voting system available for public review.

The repository is not used for active development, but will be kept up to date,
so the code that can be found here is the code that is used for election. As
the voting system used for legally binding elections must strictly follow the
legislation, the actual development of Estonian i-voting system is supervised
by National Electoral Committee (NEC) and Internet Voting Committee
(www.vvk.ee). The current partner for NEC is Cybernetica AS (www.cyber.ee).

Additional information on the source code can be found on the NEC website:

Those, who are not familiar with Estonian language may refer to the following
website, which contains subset of the information in English:
