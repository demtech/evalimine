Incidental Analysis
===================
- vote_analyzer.analyze() has empty implementation.
- analyze used in hesdisp.__hts_vote to check that a (person x vote x
  votebox) triple is "good".  analysis is only logged though.  actual
  analysis used to branch is defined eventually in hesdisp.__proxy

=====================
Rough Size and Nature
=====================
Totals grouped by language (dominant language first):
python:        9892 (59.46%)
cpp:           6487 (38.99%)
sh:             257 (1.54%)

Total Physical Source Lines of Code (SLOC)                = 16,636
Development Effort Estimate, Person-Years (Person-Months) = 3.83 (45.95)
 (Basic COCOMO model, Person-Months = 2.4 * (KSLOC**1.05))
Schedule Estimate, Years (Months)                         = 0.89 (10.71)
 (Basic COCOMO model, Months = 2.5 * (person-months**0.38))
Estimated Average Number of Developers (Effort/Schedule)  = 4.29
Total Estimated Cost to Develop                           = $ 517,301
 (average salary = $56,286/year, overhead = 2.40).

Total comments in Python code ~225 lines.
Comment coverage in Python code = 225/9892 = 2.3%

Total comments in C++ code ~80 lines.
Comment coverage in C++ code = 80/6487 = 1.2%

==================================
Use of Basic Good Coding Practices
==================================
- 2 assertions in C++ code
- 1 assertion in Python code (for a default case in CLO processing)
- 1 function comment
- The majority of comments are in reused library code, not in
  Estonia's code (proper).

=====
Build
=====
Relies upon:
 - Python 2.7
 - pychecker
 - pylint
 - dpkg

Build system hints at test files (test_*) but they do not exist.
System will not even build as missing test files trigger failure.

- pylint target runs and gives one failure:
  ksum.py:88: [E1121, votehash] Too many positional arguments for function call

- Build presumes existence of dpkg-architecture (and thus, we are some
  flavors of Linux).  dpkg can be easily installed via Brew, but the
  OS X version is not configured by default to actually install
  software.  dpkg support is a big mess, especially on OS X via Brew
  and MacPorts.

- Tons of implicit dependencies in Python code that are nearly
  undocumented.  They are mentioned offhandedly in debian/changelog.
  + bdocpython (BDOC? http://wpki.eu/wiki/upload/8/82/BDoc-1.0.pdf)
  + Mobiil-ID (Is necessary code public?)  http://mobiil.id.ee/
  + Uus HSM (hardware security module?  YubiKeys?)
  + kontrollitavus

- Example Apache server config looks fine.  SSL configuration looks
  ok.  SSL is only used for HES.  Certificates are included in the
  code drop.

- Large amount of included code is lifted from libraries and is used
  for handling server-side crypto (particularly certificate
  management).  "Borrowed" code has no attribution of source,
  authorship, or license.  E.g., base64 from John Walker and in the
  public domain.  countLines taken from GNU's wc (tch tch).

- Decryption is multi-threaded

- No harness included.

- Main method included in several subsystems:
  hts/htsdisp
  hts/htsalldisp
  hlr/threaded_decrypt
  hlr/hlr
  debian/repo
  common/replace_candidates
  common/regrights
  common/ksum
  common/hts_state
  common/config_hth
  common/config_hsm
  common/config_hlr_input
  common/config_common
  common/config_bdoc
  common/check_inputlists
  common/apply_changes

- Tarvi Martens's name not mentioned anywhere.

===================
Need to Investigate 
===================
- Public SVN server
  https://svn.eesti.ee/projektid/idkaart_public/trunk/libdigidocpp/

- Provided Apache configuration
  ivote-server/cgi/

- appConfig.json?
- SSLVerifyClient only for hes.cgi
    SSLVerifyDepth 2
    SSLProtocol -SSLv2 -SSLv3 +TLSv1 -TLSv1.1 -TLSv1.2
    SSLOptions +ExportCertData +StrictRequire
    SSLCipherSuite TLSv1:!LOW:!MD5:!EXP:!DH:!NULL:!RC4
   SetHandler cgi-script


- hts-verify-vote.cgi !!

- Logging subsystem
  common/evlog.py

- Missing test files hinted at by build system (test_*)

- Mobiil-ID (http://mobiil.id.ee/)
