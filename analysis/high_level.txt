Incidental Analysis
===================
- vote_analyzer.analyze() has empty implementation.
- analyze used in hesdisp.__hts_vote to check that a (person x vote x
  votebox) triple is "good".  analysis is only logged though.  actual
  analysis used to branch is defined eventually in hesdisp.__proxy

=====================
Rough Size and Nature
=====================
Totals grouped by language (dominant language first):
python:        9892 (59.46%)
cpp:           6487 (38.99%)
sh:             257 (1.54%)

Total Physical Source Lines of Code (SLOC)                = 16,636
Development Effort Estimate, Person-Years (Person-Months) = 3.83 (45.95)
 (Basic COCOMO model, Person-Months = 2.4 * (KSLOC**1.05))
Schedule Estimate, Years (Months)                         = 0.89 (10.71)
 (Basic COCOMO model, Months = 2.5 * (person-months**0.38))
Estimated Average Number of Developers (Effort/Schedule)  = 4.29
Total Estimated Cost to Develop                           = $ 517,301
 (average salary = $56,286/year, overhead = 2.40).

Total comments in Python code ~225 lines.
Comment coverage in Python code = 225/9892 = 2.3%

Total comments in C++ code ~80 lines.
Comment coverage in C++ code = 80/6487 = 1.2%

==================================
Use of Basic Good Coding Practices
==================================
- 2 assertions in C++ code
- 1 assertion in Python code (for a default case in CLO processing)
- 1 function comment
- The majority of comments are in reused library code, not in
  Estonia's code (proper).

=====
Build
=====
Relies upon:
 - Python 2.7
 - pychecker
 - pylint
 - dpkg

Build system hints at test files (test_*) but they do not exist.
System will not even build as missing test files trigger failure.

- pylint target runs and gives one failure:
  ksum.py:88: [E1121, votehash] Too many positional arguments for function call

- Build presumes existence of dpkg-architecture (and thus, we are some
  flavors of Linux).  dpkg can be easily installed via Brew, but the
  OS X version is not configured by default to actually install
  software.  dpkg support is a big mess, especially on OS X via Brew
  and MacPorts.

- Tons of implicit dependencies in Python code that are nearly
  undocumented.  They are mentioned offhandedly in debian/changelog.

  + Uus HSM (hardware security module?  YubiKeys?)

===================
Need to Investigate 
===================
- Public SVN server
  https://svn.eesti.ee/projektid/idkaart_public/trunk/libdigidocpp/

- Provided Apache configuration
  ivote-server/cgi/

- Logging subsystem
  common/evlog.py

- Missing test files hinted at by build system (test_*)

- Mobiil-ID (http://mobiil.id.ee/)
